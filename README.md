# Modified Files
The original starter template was taken from [this udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).  The following files have been modified or added by me:

## README.md
You are here, rewritten completely primarily to give "clear instructions for installing and launching the project."

# Contributing
This is an assessed project, so I'd probably get in trouble for accepting external input.

# Code Status
Can Udacity add a badge here..?

# License
This is an assessed project, based on starter code developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com) for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).  I couldn't find a licence with that code, but assume this fork would take the same, if open source.
