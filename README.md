# Known issues
## requires react router install
Despite the rubric requirement that the application requires only `npm install` and `npm start` to launch, I have used React Router (which may reqire installation, as listed above).  It is assumed that Udacity staff would weigh in in [this slack discussion](https://udacity-react.slack.com/archives/C5T2LCD53/p1503956702000051?thread_ts=1501879113.502743&cid=C5T2LCD53) if this is not permitted.

Since we're installing react router, we may as well install escape-string-regexp and sort-by too...

# Modified Files
The original starter template was taken from [this udacity repo](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).  The following files have been modified or added by me:

## README.md
You are here, rewritten completely primarily to give "clear instructions for installing and launching the project."

## App.js

## BookListing.js


# Contributing
This is an assessed project, so I'd probably get in trouble for accepting external input.

# Code Status
Can Udacity add a badge here..?

# License
This is an assessed project, based on starter code developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com) for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).  I couldn't find a licence with that code, but assume this fork would take the same, if open source.
